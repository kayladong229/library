# library
A library/book tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of building this project was to practice creating objects with a constructor function and display them dynamically on a website.

Users can add a new book by clicking the dark blue "ADD NEW BOOK" button at the top, which then brings up a form in a modal. Once users have filled out the appropriate information in the form, the information will be presented in a new table row. 

The row can be colored light blue depending on whether users have read the newly added book or not. The read status can even be toggled when clickling the "Mark as read" button. Users can also delete any books that are currently in the table by clicking the "Delete" button.
